# What is CORE?

You can read about the full concept of CORE here: [Full CHORUS Documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qXp0-kV4HUEdkB1A_epyTnopkdUdl3rY/view?usp=sharing).

CORE is for those who think in constellations, not straight lines. It offers structure without rigidity, and clarity without collapse. It is more than a way to arrange notes ‚Äì it is a way to navigate your own cognition and express it.

It gives form to cognitive movement, showing how meaning drifts, circles, or crystallizes over time. CORE does not ask you to tame your thoughts into tidy lists; it asks you to place them, tag them, color them, and connect what matters.

## The CORE Loop

CORE provides a rhythm for turning thoughts into tangible output: **Chunk**, **Orient**, **Relate**, **Express**.

- **Chunk**: Break ideas into self-contained blocks. Assign one tag (its function) and one color (its emotional tone).
- **Orient**: Place chunks spatially. Let proximity suggest importance; clusters indicate themes.
- **Relate**: Draw arrows to show flow and connection between ideas.
- **Express**: When the map feels right, turn it into an outline, draft, or action list.

## Chunk Types & Shapes

A chunk's shape is determined by its functional tag. You do not select shapes manually; you select the chunk's purpose, and the shape is assigned automatically.

## Color Tags (Emotional Cues)

Color is used to signal the emotional tone or temperature of a chunk. It is independent of the chunk's structural role.

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| üü¢ Green | Grounded, stable |
| üü° Yellow | Curious, exploratory |
| üîµ Blue | Calm, reflective |
| üü£ Purple | Deep, contemplative |
| üî¥ Red | Urgency, conflict |
| ü©∂ Grey | Fog, uncertainty |
