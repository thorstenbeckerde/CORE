# What is CORE?

CORE is for those who think in constellations, not straight lines. It offers structure without rigidity, and clarity without collapse. It is more than a way to arrange notes ‚Äì it is a way to navigate your own cognition and express it.

You can read about the full concept of CORE [here](#).

It gives form to cognitive movement, showing how meaning drifts, circles, or crystallizes over time. CORE does not ask you to tame your thoughts into tidy lists; it asks you to place them, tag them, color them, and connect what matters.

## The CORE Loop

CORE provides a rhythm for turning thoughts into tangible output: **Chunk**, **Orient**, **Relate**, **Express**.

- **Chunk** ‚Äì Break ideas into self-contained blocks. Assign one tag (its function) and one color (its emotional tone).
- **Orient** ‚Äì Place chunks spatially. Let proximity suggest importance; clusters indicate themes.
- **Relate** ‚Äì Draw arrows to show flow and connection between ideas.
- **Express** ‚Äì When the map feels right, turn it into an outline, draft, or action list.

## Chunk Types

A chunk's shape is determined by its functional tag. You select the chunk's purpose, and the shape is assigned automatically.

### Main Chunks
| Tag | Shape | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `#central` | ‚óØ | The seed thought, core concept |
| `#essential` | ‚ñ¢ | Key supporting points or moments |
| `#expanded` | ‚óá | Deeper exploration, examples, nuance |
| `#supportive` | ‚ñ± | Details, quotes, sensory notes |
| `#transition` | ‚§£ | Bridge between sections or ideas |
| `#loopback` | ‚Ü∫ | Refers to another chunk, prior note, or core concept |
| `#conclusive` | = | Ending remarks, reflection, resolution |

### Optional Chunks (Formal/Analytical)
| Tag | Shape | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `#contextual` | ‚ìò | Background information, historical context, or literature review content |
| `#counterpoint` | ‚â† | Opposing viewpoints, limitations, or challenges to the central idea |
| `#application` | ‚á¢ | Practical implications, "how-to" elements, or real-world relevance |

### Narrative Extensions
| Tag | Shape | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `#temporal` | ‚ó∑ | Passage of time (e.g., "Later that evening‚Ä¶") |
| `#spatial` | ‚åñ | Location change (e.g., "Across the city‚Ä¶") |
| `#spatiotemporal` | ‚ó∑+‚åñ | Time and location shift (e.g., "Meanwhile, in Tokyo‚Ä¶") |
| `#flashback` | ‚Ü∂ | Past event or memory outside the main timeline |

### Conceptual Add-ons

## Color Tags (Emotional Cues)

Color signals the emotional tone or temperature of a chunk. It is independent of the chunk's structural role.

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| üü¢ Green | Grounded, stable |
| üü° Yellow | Curious, exploratory |
| üîµ Blue | Calm, reflective |
| üü£ Purple | Deep, contemplative |
| üî¥ Red | Urgency, conflict |
| üîò Grey | Fog, uncertainty |
```

This now has **the same shape icons** you use in CORE right inside the tables, so it looks visually like the UI without needing images.

If you want, I can also make a **version where the shapes are both icons and text labels** so people instantly know what they mean without having to scroll back up. That works well for first-time readers. Would you like me to do that?
